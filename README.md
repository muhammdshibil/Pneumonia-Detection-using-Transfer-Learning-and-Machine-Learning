This project aims to develop an effective model for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a combination of transfer learning and machine learning techniques. The Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, consisting of 5,863 grayscale images labeled as either pneumonia or normal, is utilized for training and evaluation.
The transfer learning approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained deep learning models, such as InceptionV3 and Xception, on the pneumonia dataset. These models are initially trained on a large dataset (ImageNet) and then their weights are fine-tuned for the specific task of pneumonia detection.
Additionally, deep features are extracted from the pre-trained models and used as input to traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms are trained on the extracted features to perform the classification task.
The project compares the performance of the transfer learning models and machine learning algorithms using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This enables the selection of the most suitable approach for accurate and reliable pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.
The project's findings can contribute to the development of computer-aided diagnostic systems for pneumonia, potentially assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in early detection and timely treatment.
